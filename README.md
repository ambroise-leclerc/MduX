MduX: Medical Device Software Manufacturer Framework
⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT WARNING

This project is an experimental early evaluation of C++23 modules feasibility for cross-platform development with rich dependencies (Vulkan graphics, medical device compliance frameworks). It represents an attempt to leverage C++23 and emerging C++26 safety evolutions for medical device software development.

Current Status:

C++23 modules support requires cutting-edge toolchains (GCC 15+, MSVC 17.14+, Clang 20+)
CMake 4.x+ experimental support for import std;
Cross-platform compatibility still evolving
Medical device compliance framework is conceptual/educational
Exploring modern C++ safety features for medical device reliability
Not recommended for production use. This project serves as a technical proof-of-concept for modern C++ module systems and safety evolutions in complex, regulated software environments.
