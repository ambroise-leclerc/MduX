## 1. Scope

### 1.1 General

This document specifies life cycle processes for medical device software. The set of processes, activities, and tasks described herein establishes a common framework for medical device software life cycle processes.

**AI-Agent Context**: This standard applies to medical device software and software within medical devices. The framework provides structured guidance for AI systems managing medical software development workflows.

**Exclusions**:
- Software utilised in the manufacturing of medical devices
- Software utilised in software tools that are not integral to the finished medical device
- Software that is itself a medical device or accessory to a medical device

### 1.2 Relationship to Quality Management Systems

The medical device manufacturer shall incorporate the software life cycle processes described in this standard into their quality management system. These processes are intended for utilisation in conjunction with ISO 13485.

**AI-Agent Integration Note**: Quality management systems require systematic documentation and process adherence that AI agents can support through automated compliance checking and process monitoring.

### 1.3 Software Safety Classification

This standard defines three safety classes for medical device software based upon the potential consequences of software failure:

#### Class A: Non-Injury or Damage
**Definition**: Software that cannot contribute to a hazardous situation.
**AI-Agent Processing**: Risk level = LOW, Testing requirements = BASIC, Documentation requirements = STANDARD

#### Class B: Non-Life-Threatening Injury
**Definition**: Software that could contribute to a non-life-threatening injury or damage to the patient, operator, or environment.
**AI-Agent Processing**: Risk level = MEDIUM, Testing requirements = ENHANCED, Documentation requirements = COMPREHENSIVE

#### Class C: Death or Serious Injury
**Definition**: Software that could contribute to death or serious injury to the patient, operator, or environment.
**AI-Agent Processing**: Risk level = HIGH, Testing requirements = EXTENSIVE, Documentation requirements = EXHAUSTIVE
