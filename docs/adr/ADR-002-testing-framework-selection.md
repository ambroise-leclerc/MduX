# ADR-002: Testing Framework Selection for Medical Device Compliance

## Status
Proposed

## Context
MduX requires a comprehensive testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology while maintaining strict compliance with IEC 62304 (software lifecycle) and IEC 62366 (usability engineering) standards for Class B and Class C medical devices.

The current testing implementation uses a basic custom test runner that lacks:
- BDD support for requirements traceability
- Comprehensive test reporting and documentation
- Advanced test organization and parameterization
- Medical device compliance reporting capabilities
- Integration with regulatory documentation workflows

Key requirements:
- **IEC 62304 Compliance**: Traceability from requirements to test cases, comprehensive test documentation, risk-based testing
- **IEC 62366 Compliance**: Usability testing support, user interface validation, error scenario testing
- **BDD Support**: Given-When-Then syntax for clear requirements mapping
- **C++23 Compatibility**: Modern C++ standard support
- **Header-Only Integration**: Maintain MduX's header-only architecture
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, Linux, macOS compatibility
- **Regulatory Documentation**: Automated test report generation for medical device validation

## Medical Device Testing Considerations

### IEC 62304 Requirements (Software Lifecycle)
- **Traceability Matrix**: Direct mapping between requirements, test cases, and implementation
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Test prioritization based on software safety classification
- **Test Documentation**: Comprehensive test procedures, expected results, and actual results
- **Regression Testing**: Automated validation that changes don't introduce new defects
- **Coverage Analysis**: Verification that all safety-critical code paths are tested

### IEC 62366 Requirements (Usability Engineering)
- **Use Case Testing**: Validation of user workflows and interaction patterns
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Verification of error handling and user guidance
- **Interface Consistency**: Testing across different platforms and configurations
- **User Interface Risk Analysis**: Testing scenarios identified in usability risk analysis
- **Accessibility Testing**: Compliance with medical device accessibility requirements

### Regulatory Documentation Needs
- **Test Plans**: Formal documentation of testing approach and scope
- **Test Procedures**: Step-by-step test execution instructions
- **Test Reports**: Comprehensive results documentation with traceability
- **Defect Tracking**: Integration with issue tracking for regulatory audit trails
- **Change Control**: Documentation of test changes and their impact assessment

## Decision
**Selected Framework: Catch2 v3 with BDD Extensions**

Primary choice: **Catch2 v3.4+** with custom BDD macros and medical device compliance extensions
Supporting tools: **Custom compliance reporting** and **traceability matrix generator**

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Catch2 v3 with BDD Extensions âœ… (Selected)
**Pros:**
- Modern C++23 support with header-only distribution
- Built-in BDD support with SCENARIO/GIVEN/WHEN/THEN macros
- Excellent test organization with sections and tags
- Comprehensive test output and reporting capabilities
- Strong community support and medical device industry adoption
- Mature, stable framework with proven reliability
- Integrated with CMake and major IDEs
- Supports test parameterization and data-driven testing
- Tag-based test organization for regulatory requirements

**Cons:**
- Requires custom extensions for full IEC 62304/62366 compliance
- Limited out-of-box medical device reporting features
- May need additional tooling for traceability matrix generation

### 2. Google Test (gtest) with BDD Extensions
**Pros:**
- Industry standard with extensive tooling ecosystem
- Strong parameterized testing support
- Good IDE integration and debugging support
- Mature framework with extensive documentation

**Cons:**
- Limited native BDD support (requires third-party extensions)
- More complex setup for header-only integration
- Heavier framework that may not align with MduX simplicity
- Less natural BDD syntax compared to Catch2

### 3. Cucumber-CPP
**Pros:**
- Native BDD framework with Gherkin syntax
- Excellent for acceptance testing and stakeholder communication
- Strong traceability between features and tests
- Natural language test descriptions

**Cons:**
- Complex setup and integration overhead
- Requires additional Ruby/Java dependencies
- Not designed for unit testing (better for integration/acceptance)
- Limited C++23 support and medical device adoption
- Heavy dependency footprint conflicts with header-only design

### 4. doctest
**Pros:**
- Fastest compilation times
- Single header implementation
- Good BDD support with scenarios
- Minimal overhead and simple syntax

**Cons:**
- Smaller community and ecosystem
- Limited medical device industry adoption
- Fewer advanced features for complex test scenarios
- Less mature reporting and tooling ecosystem

### 5. Custom Framework Extension
**Pros:**
- Complete control over medical device compliance features
- Tailored specifically for IEC 62304/62366 requirements
- Minimal dependencies and perfect integration

**Cons:**
- Significant development and maintenance overhead
- Limited community support and testing
- Risk of introducing framework bugs in medical device software
- Time and resource intensive development
- Regulatory validation burden for custom framework

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Strong foundation for IEC 62304/62366 compliance
- **BDD Support**: Clear requirements traceability with Given-When-Then syntax
- **Modern C++**: Full C++23 support with header-only distribution
- **Test Organization**: Comprehensive tagging and sectioning for regulatory categories
- **Documentation**: Automated generation of test reports for regulatory submission
- **Industry Adoption**: Proven framework with medical device industry usage
- **Extensibility**: Custom macros and extensions for medical device specific needs

### Negative
- **Custom Extensions Required**: Need to develop compliance-specific features
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs training on BDD methodology and Catch2 advanced features
- **Additional Tooling**: Requires development of traceability and reporting tools

### Risks
- **Compliance Gaps**: Custom extensions might not fully meet regulatory requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Engage regulatory consultants for validation of testing approach
- **Framework Updates**: Catch2 updates might break custom extensions
  - *Mitigation*: Pin framework version, test extensions with updates
- **Documentation Burden**: Increased documentation requirements for BDD tests
  - *Mitigation*: Automated documentation generation and templates

        config.height = 768;
        
        WHEN("The window is created") {
            mdux::Window window(config);
            
            THEN("The window should be compliant with medical device standards") {
                REQUIRE(window.getSize().first == 1024);
                REQUIRE(window.getSize().second == 768);
                REQUIRE_FALSE(window.shouldClose());
            }
            
            AND_THEN("The graphics context should be properly initialized") {
                // Verify OpenGL context meets medical device requirements
                REQUIRE(mdux::Graphics::isEnabled);
