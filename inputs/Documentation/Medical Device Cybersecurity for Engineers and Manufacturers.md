## Foreword

Whether we're in the doctor's office for a routine checkup, monitoring our heart rate with a wearable device on a morning jog, or having surgery in the operating room, we rarely think about the devices that we use for medical care being vulnerable to a cybersecurity attack. However, the benefits from rapid advances in the use and capabilities of connected health also come with potential risks.

According to the American Hospital Association (AHA), the United States is home to over 6,000 hospitals, ranging from small community hospitals with fewer than 50 beds to health systems with well over 3,000 beds. In general, hospitals have 3–6 networked medical devices per bed. That means with a total of 931,203 staffed hospital beds across the United States, there are some 3–6 million connected medical devices at hospital bedsides alone, all of which must be protected against cyberattacks.

In addition, health delivery organizations, including hospitals, depend on nonmedical devices such as infrastructure systems that control elevators running, maintain temperature and air quality, provide lighting and facilitate rapid remote communications for their continued operations. This is evident that patient safety and quality of care depend on cybersafety, yet we have a large risk exposure of an estimated 10–15 million total connected devices (including infrastructure and supporting devices) that, if compromised, could lead to patient harm or care delivery impact.

This fact is acutely on the minds of both healthcare providers who manage the devices and medical technology and health I.T. informatics who manufacture them. Certain principles must be understood when we think about healthcare cybersecurity:

1. Because the threat landscape is constantly evolving, network and device security have difficulty keeping up;

2. Healthcare institutions do not have the time, money, capabilities, or resources to independently fix cyber vulnerabilities;

3. Patching updates and addressing vulnerabilities in the active medical device ecosystem can be more complicated than your average I.T. update because there may be a human, not an app or machine, connected to that device and system reboot may not be an option;

4. There are limits to the ability of government regulation to achieve the necessary balance of innovation, effectiveness, security, and privacy.

It is now recognized that these shared challenges are also a shared responsibility. In response, the public and private sectors are working together to address these healthcare cybersecurity challenges in multiple forward-looking ways. It can indeed be argued that working together is an imperative. Health care is considered one of the nation's 16 critical infrastructure sectors—like electricity, telecommunications, water, chemicals, transportation, and more. And because private industry owns and operates the vast majority of these critical infrastructures, which constitute essential public resources, it is their responsibility to serve the public good in addition to their commercial interests. That's why this shared responsibility is so important, from the engineers to the C-Suite, to work toward strengthening the security of our healthcare systems and the medical technology that has become indispensable for our nation's health.

The Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC)—a public-private partnership of health sector and government stakeholders dedicated to strengthening the nation's critical healthcare infrastructure against all hazards—convenes these interdependent stakeholders to improve the security and resiliency across the healthcare ecosystem. An HSCC task group focused on the medical device security issue head-on, working over 18 months to publish in January 2019 a best practices guide for medical technology companies—the Medical Device and Health I.T. Joint Security Plan (JSP). This is one of the many useful resources referenced in the book you're now reading—*Medical Device Cybersecurity for Engineers and Manufacturers*.

The JSP utilizes security by design principles throughout the product lifecycle of medical devices and health I.T. solutions. It encourages shared responsibility in the adoption of security-related standards, risk assessment methodologies, and vulnerability reporting requirements to improve information sharing between manufacturers and healthcare organizations. The JSP is a living document and will be updated as appropriate to adapt to the ever-changing threat environment for medical devices and health I.T. solutions.

More follow-up thought is now being given to how hospitals, device manufacturers, and government can coordinate to better communicate with patients about device vulnerabilities and security, and how we can deal with the challenging issue of aging medical technologies that have reached the end of supported life—whether because of security or operational efficiency—but are not easily replaced because of tremendous expense. Again, the shared challenge meets shared responsibility and collaborative solutions.

These and other critical issues are being addressed in sector-wide work streams, such as

• An HSCC resource for health providers called the Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices (HICP);

• The FDA's September 10, 2019 Patient Engagement Advisory Committee, which sought to understand how best to communicate cybersecurity risks in health risk communications to patients (https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/patient-engagement-advisory-committee/september-10-2019-patient-engagement-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement-09102019-09102019);

• Efforts to define and operationalize the imperative for software bills of materials to help health systems understand which software components are in the devices and systems they purchase and hence how to manage associated risk (https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_healthcare_poc_report_final_draft_2019_0904.pdf);

• Expansion of the annual DefCon Biohacking Village Device Hacking Lab, where hackers, healthcare providers, and device manufacturers collaborate to identify vulnerabilities (https://www.villageb.io/device-lab);

• The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) cybersecurity working group, made up of industry and regulators and co-led by FDA and Health Canada, which is seeking to promote a globally harmonized approach to medical device cybersecurity via drafting of a cybersecurity guide (http://www.imdrf.org/consultations/cons-ppmdc.asp).

We see all these collaborations as signs of significant progress. In 2017, a health care cybersecurity task force of industry and government leaders diagnosed that healthcare cybersecurity is in critical condition. While we have had no reports to date that cyber incidents involving medical devices have led to direct patient harm, our collective action, premised on the recognition that patient safety depends on cybersafety, will go a long way toward maintaining public trust in the security, resiliency, and integrity of life-saving and life-sustaining devices we depend on, and upgrading our healthcare cybersecurity diagnosis to stable.

Good cyber hygiene is found in the products and systems we design, manufacture and maintain, and in the management of those devices and the clinical systems in which they operate. Active and continuous adoption and refinement of resources, like this guide, will help medical technology companies—their engineers, service departments, and executive management, as well as their health provider customers—step up to this shared responsibility.

## Chapter 1: Why Secure Medical Devices?

### 1.1 The Inspiration for This Book

We were inspired to write this book after a long history of working with and for medical device manufacturers (MDMs), as well as with health care delivery organizations (HDOs). The medical device industry was the first industry to be regulated to produce secure embedded devices. This has left MDMs in the odd position of being trailblazers in an industry where cybersecurity is not necessarily their principal skill set. Secure development has nothing in common with the practice of medicine; instead, it has everything to do with subtlety of design, quality of implementation, the threat landscape, and awareness of the attack vectors utilized by attackers. How to balance these concerns with the creation of a new medical device is the overriding topic of this book.

Approaches for incorporating secure development practices into the development lifecycle have not been taught in traditional educational programs until very recently, nor are models or best practices available specific to the medical device environment. This lack of training at all levels of engineers, project managers, and senior leadership is a critical shortfall, preventing MDMs from producing proactively secured devices and preventing them from constructively engaging with their customers and regulators.

This book intends to provide guidance to MDMs as to how to implement a secure medical device lifecycle in a manner that is repeatable, trackable, produces artifacts needed for regulatory submission, and actually improves the security standing of the individual medical devices as well as the larger device ecosystem. This book may also serve HDOs as an informative resource for understanding the security activities and support MDMs should perform and how HDOs and MDMs can collaborate to keep devices secure and users safe.

There are many domestic and international standards for securing medical devices (and IoT in general). However, these guidelines are not harmonized and do not provide sufficient details to actually implement such a program. In other words, they provide the *what* but not the *how*. This book intends to close that gap.

We are aware this is a very dynamic topic and that much of the specific technical content included here could be obsolete in as few as 10 years. Notwithstanding, the principles guiding secure development practices advanced within this book will remain viable and valuable even as technology evolves. Moreover, there is a need to identify a foundational position from which incremental improvements can be made and incorporated into maintaining and improving the secure development lifecycle.

### 1.2 The Evolution of Cybersecurity in Health Care

Over the past decade, our understanding of cybersecurity risks in the health care industry has been evolving. Health care has been moving from a compliance-driven industry to a more cybersecurity aware one. This is largely due to two factors:

1. **Driven by government initiatives and the desire to reduce costs and improve efficiency**, health care has increasingly digitalized (i.e., implemented more digital systems) and digitized (i.e., amassed more digital data). This increasing connectivity and integration of systems and devices containing more valuable information have not only created a broader attack surface and more attractive opportunity for malicious cyber actors, but it has also increased our dependency on the availability of these systems.

2. **Cyber adversaries, be it driven by financial or political motivation**, have become increasingly advanced and their attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted, stealthy, and unfortunately, successful. Their impact on businesses around the globe is significant and is now exceeding one trillion USD by some estimates [1].

Consequently, we are no longer thinking about cybersecurity risks merely in the context of our information systems and the data they hold but now have a more comprehensive view, including the potential impact on patient health, care delivery, hospital operations, and even on health systems at the national level.

Unfortunately, this learning experience came from a number of painful events. Ransomware attacks have resulted in the payment [2] of the demanded ransom or have forced hospitals to go through a complex and costly recovery period. For example, the WannaCry attack on the UK National Health Service (NHS) in May 2017 affected more than 1,000 IT systems and medical devices, resulting in the full or partial shutdown of 81 NHS Trust hospitals, the cancellation of 19,000 patient appointments, and a financial impact of an estimated £92 million [4].

This was followed by the NotPetya pseudo-ransomware (wiper) attack in June, which directly affected only a few health care delivery organizations, but impacted hosted documentation services, the availability of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, as well as global shipping and logistics companies [5].

Both attacks resulted in multibillion-dollar losses across the globe and across multiple industries. Yet we need to recognize that both WannaCry and NotPetya were imperfect malware containing design and execution flaws. In other words, in spite of the damage done, it could have been much worse. And, in neither case did we find out who authored the malware nor what their actual intention was (although theories exist).

### 1.3 The Unique Role of Medical Devices

As medical devices moved from the early days of beneficial uses of electricity [6] and radiation [7] to a tightly integrated system of systems where data flows not only between devices, but also between devices and hospital IT systems, we became aware that these devices were not only more vulnerable and difficult to protect, but also that the security compromise of these could result in patient harm or impact on care delivery—in addition to the traditional security concerns around data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Industry stakeholders have been aware of the cybersecurity risks of medical devices since security researchers demonstrated their ability to hack into an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) in 2008 [8]. Since then, even as individual researchers [9], hospitals [10], and government agencies [11] conduct their own additional research, all with the same results—our medical device ecosystems are highly vulnerable and we have historically failed to establish cybersecurity as a buying criterion and as a design objective. Regulators and leading medical device manufacturers have recognized the problem and are establishing a path forward.

It should also be understood that even though this book is generally using the term medical devices, the lifecycle management and security best practices described can equally be applied to a wide range of devices that are used on hospital networks, not just the ones classified as medical devices by the local

### 1.4 Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape for medical device cybersecurity has evolved significantly, driven by increasing awareness of cybersecurity risks and their potential impact on patient safety. Key regulatory developments include:

**FDA Guidance Evolution:**
- The FDA has issued comprehensive guidance documents addressing premarket and postmarket cybersecurity requirements
- Emphasis on "security by design" principles throughout the device lifecycle
- Requirements for vulnerability management and coordinated disclosure processes

**International Harmonization:**
- The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) has developed globally harmonized cybersecurity guidance
- Coordination between FDA, Health Canada, and other regulatory bodies

**Key Regulatory Requirements:**
1. **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessments must be conducted and documented
2. **Design Controls:** Security requirements must be incorporated into design controls
3. **Vulnerability Management:** Processes for identifying, assessing, and addressing vulnerabilities
4. **Postmarket Surveillance:** Ongoing monitoring and response to cybersecurity threats

### 1.5 Looking Ahead

The future of medical device cybersecurity will be characterized by:

- **Increased Integration:** Greater connectivity between medical devices, health IT systems, and cloud services

## Chapter 4: Medical Device Manufacturers' Development Cycle

### 4.1 Introduction

The medical device development lifecycle must incorporate cybersecurity considerations at every phase to ensure the creation of secure, compliant, and effective medical devices. This chapter outlines a comprehensive approach to integrating cybersecurity into the traditional device development process.

### 4.2 Secure Lifecycle Diagram Overview

The secure development lifecycle encompasses multiple phases, each with specific cybersecurity objectives and deliverables:

1. **Concept Phase:** Initial security considerations and threat landscape assessment
2. **Planning Phase:** Security requirements definition and resource allocation
3. **Requirements Phase:** Detailed security specifications and acceptance criteria
4. **Design Phase:** Secure architecture design and security control selection
5. **Implementation Phase:** Secure coding practices and security testing
6. **Verification and Validation Phase:** Comprehensive security verification
7. **Release/Transfer Phase:** Security documentation and deployment preparation
8. **Sales Phase:** Customer security information and support
9. **End of Life Phase:** Secure decommissioning and data protection

### 4.3 Threats vs. Vulnerabilities

Understanding the distinction between threats and vulnerabilities is fundamental to effective cybersecurity:

**Threats:** Potential sources of harm or adverse effects to a system
- External attackers seeking unauthorized access
- Malicious insiders with privileged access
- Unintentional user actions causing security breaches
- Natural disasters affecting system availability

**Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses that can be exploited by threats
- Software bugs and coding errors
- Misconfigurations and weak default settings
- Inadequate access controls
- Poor encryption implementation

**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**

### 4.4 Development Lifecycle: Concept Phase

During the concept phase, initial security considerations should include:

- **Market Analysis:** Understanding the threat landscape for similar devices
- **Regulatory Review:** Identifying applicable cybersecurity requirements
- **Business Case:** Incorporating security costs into project planning
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involving security experts in initial planning

#### 4.4.1 Incremental Improvements and Secure Development

For incremental improvements to existing devices:
- Review previous security assessments and vulnerabilities
- Assess impact of changes on existing security controls
- Update threat models to reflect new functionality
- Ensure security regression testing is planned

### 4.5 Development Lifecycle: Planning Phase

The planning phase establishes the foundation for secure development:

#### 4.5.1 Security Goals

Security goals should be:
- **Specific:** Clearly defined and measurable
- **Achievable:** Realistic given available resources
- **Relevant:** Aligned with business and regulatory requirements
- **Time-bound:** Associated with specific milestones

Common security goals include:
- Confidentiality of patient data
- Integrity of device functionality
- Availability of critical services
- Authentication of authorized users
- Authorization of permitted actions

### 4.6 Development Lifecycle: Requirements Phase

Security requirements must be comprehensive and traceable:

#### 4.6.1 Safe Harbor vs Full Encryption

**Safe Harbor Approach:**
- Implement industry-standard security controls
- Follow established best practices and guidelines
- Leverage proven security technologies and methods
- Document compliance with regulatory requirements

**Full Encryption Approach:**
- Implement comprehensive encryption for all data
